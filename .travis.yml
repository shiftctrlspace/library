# This file provides integration with the Travis-CI.org build service.
---
# Strictly speaking, we don't really need to set a language as we are
# building inside containers, but this speeds build time by requesting
# a minimal host image (e.g., no need to install stuff we won't use).
# See: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/minimal-and-generic/
language: minimal

# We set the following environment variables in order to trigger one
# build per list item (one build for each OS distribution).
env:
  - distro: debian9
#  - distro: debian8
#  - distro: ubuntu1804
#  - distro: ubuntu1604
#  - distro: centos7
#  - distro: fedora27

# The above `env` list creates what Travis CI calls a build matrix.
# We can customize the settings for each job in the build matrix by
# specifying them explicitly. See:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/
#matrix:
#  allow_failures:
#    - env: distro=debian8
#    - env: distro=ubuntu1804
#    - env: distro=ubuntu1604
#    - env: distro=centos7
#    - env: distro=fedora27
