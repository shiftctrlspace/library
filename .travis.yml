# This file provides integration with the Travis-CI.org build service.

# We want to build in a Docker container in order to access multiple
# Operating System environments (notably, OS's with systemd), so we
# request Travis route our build to a Docker-enabled environement.
# See:
#     https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#selecting-infrastructure-optional
#     https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/docker/

# Strictly speaking, we don't really need to set a language as we are
# building in Docker containers, but it makes the Travis GUI happier.
# See: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/minimal-and-generic/
language: minimal

# We set the following environment variables in order to trigger one
# build per list item (one build for each OS distribution).
env:
  # TODO:
  #- distribution: centos
