# This file is an example hosts inventory file for Ansible plays.
#
# You'll want to edit this file to include the IP addresses or domain
# names of your server(s), along with which groups they belong in. See
# the Ansible documentation for inventory files:
#
#     https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html
#
# In the simpler case, for example, if you just installed Raspbian on
# an RPi using the NOOBS installer provided by the Raspberry Pi
# foundation and have enabled the SSH server, you'll be able to use
# this inventory by invoking the following command:
#
#     ansible-playbook -i inventories/example/hosts --ask-pass provision.yml
#
# Otherwise, you should modify this inventory file as described in the
# Ansible documentation, linked above.

[example_library_group]
raspberry.local ansible_user=pi # Raspbian OS uses these by default.
